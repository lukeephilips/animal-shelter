          <h3>Bubbles</h3>
          <h4>Bubbles is a 4 year old <span class='species'>tiger</span>, he likes to play!</h4>

          <br>
          <p>Bubbles comes from the darkest jungles of Africa, with stops at many circuses along the way. He likes sleeping, dancing and tuna fish. He is looking for a forever home.</p><br>

          <h3>Fishstick</h3>
          <h4>Fishstick is a fierce <span class='species'>fish</span>, he will eat you in one bite!</h4>
          <img src="img/fish.jpeg" alt="shark" />
          <p>Fishstick has trouble playing nicely with others. In the right home he'd do just fine, but he has a checkered history. He's a nice fella, just don't stick your hand in his bowl.</p><br>

          <br>
          <p>What's to say? He eats, he sleeps. Move along.</p><br>
